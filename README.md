Android Basics Nanodegree Project 2

### Goal of the app
I created this app when I was doing the Android Basics Nanodegree at <a href="http://udacity.com">udacity.com</a>. The app is a point tracker tool for a Hungarian card game called 66 where you have to be the first to collect 66 points by cashing as many beats as you can. The game is played with Swiss cards with the following point values:
<ul>
<li>Under: 2</li>
<li>Over: 3</li>
<li>King: 4</li>
<li>Ten: 10</li>
<li>Ace: 11</li>
<li>Over and king of the same suit: 20</li>
<li>Over and king of the favoured color: 40</li>
</ul>
